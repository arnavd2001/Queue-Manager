This Project uses the Face Recognition Library, to detect faces in queues. We use Haar Cascade as the Cascade Classifier, and we take into consideration frontal as well as side face angles.
A rectangle  frame is formed around the face of the persons in the queue.
The output is received as in the images below.
Run the fullfacefetect.py to get the output.
